# Frontend test answers

## Available Scripts

Run the dotnet server in the FrontEndTest folder first.

Then in this project directory, use:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Assumptions

1. The base code on the FrontEndTest didn't work for me, mainly because of CORS errors
Which is why I modified the Program.cs to allow for CORS.
2. I also assumed most logic would be handled in the backend, so data sanitization isn't heavy.
Validation is still included.
3. I was allowed to use css frame works i.e. bootstrap as a base template for the UI + Sass for css preprocessing.
4. Age did not have a specific range so assumed 0 < Age < 120.
5. Since this is a basic test, there are a few css bugs. 
6. Design was not a huge factor of being assessed.
